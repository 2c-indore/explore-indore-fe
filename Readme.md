## explore-indore-fe

Front end repository for Explore Indore (Explore Pokhara clone). Currently the dev version of the app is hosted [here](http://exploreindore.klldev.org).

### Getting Started
Use the following steps to get started with the dev version of the application:

1. Clone this repository using the command line: `git clone https://github.com/2c-indore/explore-indore-fe.git`
2. Switch to `develop` branch: `git checkout develop`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start development server: `npm run start`
5. The app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`

Note: Some of the dependencies are a little old, as a result, there might be weird looking messages when running `npm install`. We will be fixing them at a later date.


### Contributing guide
We will be using the git-flow based model to manage changes to the app.

1. We wiil be maintaining two core branches, `master` and `develop` with `master` containing the last release, and `develop` containing the latest stable version.
2. All core contributors are required to work on the `develop` branch.
3. Depending on the nature of the work, branch types can be of two types, `feature/feature-name` and `hotfix/hotfix-name` which upon completion of work should be merged to the develop branch.
4. You can learn more about gitflow in this excellent [stackoverflow answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/255404/how-to-use-github-branches-and-automatic-releases-for-version-management).
